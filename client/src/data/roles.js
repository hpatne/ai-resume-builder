 * roles.js
 * SAMPLE DATA: six job roles. Each role drives the content the mock AI writes
 * (deliverable D5) and the keywords the ATS checker looks for (D7):
 *   requiredSkills     -> hard skills; pre-filled into the Skills section and
 *                         weighted highest in the ATS score
 *   keywords           -> softer role keywords used by the keyword panel / ATS
 *   sampleSummary      -> summary template; {company} is replaced with the target
 *   experienceBullets  -> bullet points for the Experience section
 *   projects           -> sample projects for the Projects section
 *   certifications     -> suggested certifications
 * Admins can add, edit and delete roles on /admin/roles.
 * TODO (Phase 2): replace mock with real API call to the Express backend
